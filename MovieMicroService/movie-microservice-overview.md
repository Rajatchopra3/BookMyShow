Overview :

The Movie Microservice is a core component of a larger microservices-based architecture, responsible for managing movie-related data and business logic. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on movie information, such as storing details about movies, managing updates, and ensuring data consistency across the system.

The service integrates with MongoDB to store movie data, leveraging its flexibility to handle complex or evolving data structures. To ensure the overall system remains synchronized, the Movie Microservice adopts an event-driven architecture. This allows it to publish events (e.g., MovieCreated, MovieUpdated, MovieDeleted) to a message broker whenever a movie is created, updated, or deleted. These events enable other microservices, such as the Search Service, Recommendation Service to stay up to date with the changes in real time.

By using a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka), the Movie Microservice can communicate asynchronously with other services, minimizing tight coupling and ensuring that each service operates independently. This also supports horizontal scalability, reliability, and eventual consistency across the distributed system.
